# Off-Grid Survival Emotionally Intelligent Bot

I want to build an off grid all in one package which can listens and respond to voice queries.

It'll also have a "face" with motorized eye brows, nose and mouth and use those to express emotions.

It'll be powered from powerbank and will also have a solar panel for full autonomy.
