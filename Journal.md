Idea: create "animated face"

29 June 2025

Today is DEADLINE.

Clarify the idea:

- use LLM and Raspberry Pi
- how about Gemma 3n from Google, there is 6B version which should fir 8GB Raspberry Pi 5
- we need text to speech, oh, well we can use [Kokoro-82M](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M)
- we can animate the face and mouth with little servos
- let's also add 8x8 LEDs for eyes!
